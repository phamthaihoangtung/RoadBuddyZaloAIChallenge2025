Got it, let's look at the video. The question is about the direction when the car turns right. The signs in the video: the road signs above the highway. In the first frame, there's a sign that says ""Dầu Giây Long Thành"" maybe. Wait, the options are B. Dầu Giây Long Thành, C. Đường Đỗ Xuân Hợp, D. Xa Lộ Hà Nội.

Looking at the signs in the video. The first frame has overhead signs. One of them is ""Dầu Giây Long Thành"" – that's probably the direction for turning right. Because when the car is on the highway, the signs indicate exits. If the car is turning right, it would go into the road corresponding to the sign. So option B is Dầu Giây Long Thành. Let me check again. The signs in the video: the blue signs. In the first frame, there's a sign that says ""Dầu Giây Long Thành"" – so if the car is turning right, it's going into that road. Therefore, the answer should be B.

Theo trong video, nếu ô tô đi hướng chếch sang phải là hướng vào đường Xa Lộ Hà Nội. Đúng hay sai? A. Đúng B. Sai

Got it, let's figure this out. The question is about whether the car going to the right is heading to Xa Lộ Hà Nội. First, I need to look at the road signs in the video. The video shows a highway at night with signs. The blue sign says ""Đường Xa Lộ Hà Nội"" which means Xa Lộ Hà Nội Road. Now, the direction: if the car is going to the right, does that correspond to Xa Lộ Hà Nội?

Looking at the signs in the video, there's a blue sign with ""Xa Lộ Hà Nội"" and the arrow direction. The car is on a road where the signs indicate directions. The question is if going right leads to Xa Lộ Hà Nội. Wait, the road signs: typically, in Vietnam, road signs have arrows. The sign for Xa Lộ Hà Nội would have an arrow pointing towards that road. If the car is taking the right lane, does that lane lead to Xa Lộ Hà Nội?

In the first frame, the signs show the direction. The blue sign says ""Đường Xa Lộ Hà Nội"" with an arrow. So the lane corresponding to that arrow would be the direction to Xa Lộ Hà Nội. Now, the question is if going right (i.e., the right lane) is towards Xa Lộ Hà Nội. But maybe the direction of the arrow on the sign indicates which lane. Wait, the video's perspective is from the car's windshield. The sign says ""Xa Lộ Hà Nội"" and the arrow is pointing left or right? Wait, in the image, the blue sign has ""Xa Lộ Hà Nội"" and the arrow. Let's check the sign direction.

In Vietnam, road signs: ""Đường Xa Lộ Hà Nội"" would be a direction. The arrow on the sign would indicate which lane or direction. If the sign's arrow is pointing right, then the right lane is for Xa Lộ Hà Nội. But the question says ""nếu ô tô đi hướng chếch sang phải là hướng vào đường Xa Lộ Hà Nội"". So if the car goes right (chếch sang phải), is that direction to Xa Lộ Hà Nội?

Wait, the video's first frame has a sign with ""Đường Xa Lộ Hà Nội"" and the arrow. Let's think: the sign might have an arrow indicating that the direction towards Xa Lộ Hà Nội is the right lane. But if the car is going right, then yes. But maybe the sign's arrow points left. Wait, the problem is in Vietnamese. The sign says ""Xa Lộ Hà Nội"" which is a road name. The arrow direction is important.

Alternatively, maybe the car is moving forward, and the direction to Xa Lộ Hà Nội is the right turn. But in the video, the car is on a multi-lane road. The signs are above the road. The blue sign with ""Xa Lộ Hà Nội"" would indicate that the road named Xa Lộ Hà Nội is in a particular direction. If the arrow on the sign is pointing right, then taking the right lane goes to Xa Lộ Hà Nội. But the question is: if the car goes right (chếch sang phải), is that towards Xa Lộ Hà Nội.

Wait, the options are A. Correct or B. Incorrect. So we need to determine based on the sign. Let's recall that in the video, the sign says ""Đường Xa Lộ Hà Nội"" and the arrow. If the arrow on the sign indicates that Xa Lộ Hà Nội is in the right direction, then going right (chếch sang phải) would be towards it. But maybe the sign's arrow is actually pointing left? Wait, no. Let's think about typical road signs. In Vietnam, the direction signs: for example, if it's a road named ""Xa Lộ Hà Nội"", the sign would have an arrow showing the direction of that road.

Looking at the first frame, the blue sign has ""Xa Lộ Hà Nội"" and the arrow. The arrow direction: in the image, the sign is overhead. The arrow is pointing to the right? Wait, the sign in the video has text ""Xa Lộ Hà Nội"" with an arrow. Let's check the orientation. If the arrow is pointing right, then the right lane is for Xa Lộ Hà Nội. So if the car is going right (chếch sang phải, i.e., right lane), then yes, it's towards Xa Lộ Hà Nội.

But the question is a bit tricky. The question is ""nếu ô tô đi hướng chếch sang phải là hướng vào đường Xa Lộ Hà Nội. Đúng hay sai?"" So, does the right direction (chếch sang phải) correspond to Xa Lộ Hà Nội?

Got it, let's check the video. The question is whether there's a warning sign in the video. Looking at the frames: the video shows a nighttime highway with cars, streetlights, overhead signs (like the brand logos), but do any warning signs appear? Warning signs are usually triangular with exclamation marks or specific symbols. In the provided frames, there are no such signs. The overhead structures have brand logos (like Mercedes, etc.), which are not warning signs. So the answer should be B. Không.

Got it, let's look at the video. The question is about a sign that forbids a certain type of vehicle on the right side. First, I need to recall what each sign might mean. The options are bicycle, motorcycle, container truck, or sedan.

In Vietnam, road signs: a ""no motorcycle"" sign would typically be a red circle with a motorcycle symbol. Let's check the video. The first frame shows the road at night, with signs. The right side has a sign—maybe a red circle with a motorcycle (xe máy) symbol. So the sign cấm xe máy would be option B.

Wait, the options: A is xe đạp (bicycle), B xe máy (motorcycle), C xe container (container truck), D xe lam (sedan). So the sign in question—probably the one that's a no motorcycle sign. Since the question says ""biển báo cấm ở góc phía bên phải"" (forbidden sign at the right corner). So which one is forbidden. If the sign is a red circle with a motorcycle, then it's B.

Got it, let's analyze the video. First, the question is about the types of road signs in the video. Let's look at the options.

Option A: Biển báo cấm (prohibition signs), biển hiệu lệnh (command signs), biển báo trên đường cao tốc (highway signs). 

In the video, we can see a red circular sign with a line through it, which is a prohibition sign (cấm). Also, there are directional signs (chỉ dẫn). Wait, the video shows various signs. Let's check the scene. The video has traffic lights, signs above the road. The red circular sign is a prohibition sign. Also, there are signs indicating directions, like maybe road signs for directions (chỉ dẫn). Now, option B: biển báo cấm, biển chỉ dẫn. That would be prohibition and directional signs. Option C: biển chỉ dẫn, biển phụ (auxiliary signs). But let's see.

In the video, there's a sign with a red circle, which is a prohibition sign (cấm). Also, there are directional signs (chỉ dẫn). Let's check the options. Option B includes biển báo cấm and biển chỉ dẫn. Let's confirm. The question is about the types present. The video shows a red circular sign (prohibition), and other signs like direction signs (chỉ dẫn). So option B: Biển báo cấm, biển chỉ dẫn.

Got it, let's analyze the video. The question is about the directions a vehicle can go at the intersection. First, look at the traffic signs. The video shows a traffic light and road signs. In Vietnam, at intersections, the signs indicate allowed directions. The sign here—wait, the image has a sign that might show the permitted movements. Since it's a nighttime intersection with traffic lights, but the key is to see the signs. The options are straight, left, right, or all.

Looking at the video frame: there's a traffic sign above the intersection. The sign might have arrows. If it's a sign that allows all directions, then D. But need to check. In Vietnam, intersections often have signs indicating allowed turns. If the sign shows straight, left, right, then all. Wait, the video's timestamp is 2025-10-02, but that's not relevant. The road has multiple lanes. The traffic light is red, so vehicles are stopped. But the question is about which directions are allowed. The sign in the background: there's a sign that says ""Hướng dẫn giao thông"" maybe, but more importantly, the sign showing arrows. If the sign has arrows for all three directions (straight, left, right), then D. But maybe in the video, the sign is there. Since it's a multi-lane intersection, usually in Vietnam, intersections have signs indicating permitted movements. If the sign shows that all directions are allowed (like straight, left, right), then the answer is D.

Wait, the options are A. Straight, B. Left, C. Right, D. All. So if the intersection allows all three directions, then D. How to know? The traffic light is red, but the signs—maybe the sign above shows the allowed directions. Since the question is about the directions the vehicle can go, and in many intersections with proper signage, if there's a sign indicating all directions are permitted, then D. Given that the video shows a busy intersection with multiple lanes, likely the sign allows all directions. So the answer is D.

Got it, let's look at the video. The traffic signs are important here. The blue signs indicate directions. In the video, the signs show arrows for straight, left, and right? Wait, no, let's check. The signs: there's a sign with three directions—straight, left, right? Wait, no, the question is about which directions are allowed. Wait, the red traffic lights, but the signs on the overhead structure. The signs in the video (since it's a night scene with overhead signs) typically in Vietnam, the traffic signs. Let's see the options. The options are A: straight and left, B: straight and right, C: all, D: only straight.

Wait, the traffic signs in the video: the blue signs (Vietnamese traffic signs). Let's recall that in Vietnam, at intersections, the signs indicate allowed directions. The signs here—if the signs show arrows for straight, left, right, then all three. But let's check the video. The user provided the video frames. The first frame has a sign with directions: let's see the text. The signs have ""Sông Cấm"" and ""Bến Xe"" maybe, but the arrow directions. Wait, the key is the arrow directions. The overhead signs: if there are arrows for straight (straight ahead), left turn, and right turn, then all three. But in some cases, maybe only straight. Wait, the question is: ""phương tiện có thể đi được những hướng nào?"" (which directions can vehicles go).

Looking at the traffic lights: red lights, so vehicles must stop, but the signs indicate permitted directions. The signs on the overhead structure: the blue signs have arrows. Let's imagine. The blue signs usually indicate the directions for each lane. For example, a sign with a straight arrow, a left arrow, and a right arrow. If all three are present, then vehicles can go straight, left, or right. But wait, maybe in the video, the signs show only straight? Wait, the user's video is from a car's perspective. Let's check the signs.

Wait, the video shows the traffic signs: the blue signs have arrows. Let's see the second frame: the sign with ""Sông Cấm"" and other names, but the arrows. Typically, in Vietnam, at intersections, the signs for lanes: if there's a sign with three arrows (straight, left, right), then all three directions are allowed. But maybe in this case, the signs only indicate straight. Wait, no—wait, the problem is multiple choice.

Wait, the options: A is straight and left, B straight and right, C all, D only straight.

Wait, let's think about standard traffic signs. In the video, the traffic lights are red, so vehicles must stop, but the allowed directions depend on the signs. The overhead signs: the blue signs (Vietnam) have arrows. For example, if there's a sign with a straight arrow (for the middle lane), left turn (for the left lane), and right turn (for the right lane). But if the signs indicate that in each lane, the allowed direction.

But maybe in this intersection, the signs show that vehicles can go straight, left, or right. But let's check the video frames. The first frame: the sign has ""Sông Cấm"" and other text, but the arrows. Wait, the second frame: the sign has three arrows—straight, left, right? Or maybe not. Wait, maybe the signs are for the directions. Wait, the problem is, in Vietnam, the traffic signs for directions: sometimes the signs indicate the permitted movements. If there's a sign with ""straight"", ""left turn"", ""right turn"", then all three. But maybe in this case, the signs only allow straight.

Wait, but let's think differently. The question is about the directions the vehicle can go. Since it's a red light, vehicles are stopped, but the permitted directions for the next move would be based on the signs. Wait, no—when the light is red, vehicles must stop, but the signs indicate which directions are allowed for that intersection. Wait, no. The signs indicate the allowed directions for the lanes. For example, if a lane has a sign with a straight arrow, then that lane can only go straight. If it has a left turn arrow, then left turn, etc.

But looking at the video, the traffic signs: the blue signs (overhead) have multiple arrows. Let's check the second frame: the sign has three arrows—straight, left, right. So in that case, the directions allowed are all three. But the options: C is ""Đi thẳng, rẽ trái, rẽ phải"" which is straight, left, right. But wait, let's check the possible. Wait, maybe the signs only show straight.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's see the"

Got it, let's look at the video. The question is whether vehicles can turn left at the intersection. First, check the traffic signs. There's a sign that says ""No Left Turn"" (the red circle with a left arrow crossed out). So if there's a ""No Left Turn"" sign, then turning left is not allowed. Therefore, the answer should be B.
