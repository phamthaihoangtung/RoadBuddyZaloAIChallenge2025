Got it, let's look at the video. The question is about which direction the car going right would be heading. In the video, there are road signs. The first frame has signs, and the second frame also. Let's check the options. The options mention Dầu Giây Long Thành, Đường Đỗ Xuân Hợp, Xa Lộ Hà Nội. 

Looking at the signs in the video, in the first frame, there's a sign for ""Dầu Giây Long Thành"" maybe? Wait, the second frame has a sign with ""Dầu Giây Long Thành"" I think. Wait, the question is if the car goes to the right (chếch sang phải), which road is that. 

In the video, the signs: the first image shows signs, maybe the right lane is for Dầu Giây Long Thành. Let's check the options. Option B is Dầu Giây Long Thành. So the answer would be B.

Got it, let's try to figure this out. The question is about whether the car turning right is going into Xa Lo Ha Noi. First, I need to look at the road signs. In the video, there are overhead signs. The first frame shows signs, and the second frame (when the van comes) has signs. Wait, the key is to check the direction. Xa Lo Ha Noi is a specific road. In Vietnam, Xa Lo Ha Noi is a major road, but the question is about the direction. The user says ""nếu ô tô đi hướng chếch sang phải là hướng vào đường Xa Lộ Hà Nội"". So, if the car turns slightly right, is that into Xa Lo Ha Noi?

Looking at the road signs. The first frame (time 19:28:20) has signs. The second frame (19:28:33) shows the car is on a highway. Wait, the signs: in the first frame, there are signs with ""Xa Lộ Hà Nội"" maybe? Or the direction. Wait, the problem is in Vietnamese, so ""chếch sang phải"" means slightly right. But do the signs indicate that the"

Got it, let's check the video. The question is whether there's a warning sign in the video. Looking at the frames, the video shows a night driving scene with road signs above, but are they warning signs? The signs on the overpass might be directional or informational, not warning signs (which are usually triangular or indicate hazards). The visible signs here seem like route or brand signs (like Mercedes logo maybe), not warning signs. So the answer is B. Không.

Got it, let's look at the video frames. The question is whether there's a traffic light in front. In the first frame, the road has vehicles, streetlights, but no visible traffic light. The second frame also shows the road with cars, but still no traffic light. The main elements are streetlights, buildings, vehicles, but no traffic light (the red/green lights for traffic control). So the answer should be B. Không.

Trong video, biển báo cấm ở góc phía bên phải cấm loại phương tiện nào: A. Xe đạp B. Xe máy C. Xe container D. Xe lam

Got it, let's look at the video. The question is about a sign on the right corner that bans a type of vehicle. The options are A. Xe đạp (bicycle), B. Xe máy (motorcycle), C. Xe container (container truck), D. Xe lam (van). 

First, in the video, we need to check the signs. The sign in question is likely a traffic sign indicating a ban. In Vietnam, common signs for banned vehicles: for example, ""xe máy"" (motorcycle) might be banned on certain roads. Wait, the options are specific. Let's think about the context. The sign could be a no-motorcycle sign. But let's see the choices. 

Wait, the problem is in Vietnamese. The sign at the right corner—what's the type of vehicle banned. Let's recall that in some areas, there are signs that ban motorcycles. But let's check the options. Option B is xe máy (motorcycle). Alternatively, maybe another sign. But the question is which is banned. 

Wait, looking at the video's frames. The second frame (0.7s) shows some vehicles. But the key is the sign. The sign that's c"

Có những loại biển báo nào xuất hiện trong đoạn video? A. Biển báo cấm, biển hiệu lệnh, biển báo trên đường cao tốc B. Biển báo cấm, biển chỉ dẫn C. Biển chỉ dẫn, biển phụ

Got it, let's look at the video. The question is about the types of road signs in the video. The options are:

A. Biển báo cấm, biển hiệu lệnh, biển báo trên đường cao tốc

B. Biển báo cấm, biển chỉ dẫn

C. Biển chỉ dẫn, biển phụ

First, in the video, we can see a red circular sign which is a ""cấm"" (prohibition) sign. Also, there's a sign that might be a ""chỉ dẫn"" (directional) sign. Wait, the options: option B is ""Biển báo cấm, biển chỉ dẫn"". Let's check.

The video shows a red sign (cấm) and maybe a directional sign. So between the options, B includes both cấm and chỉ dẫn. Option A has ""biển báo trên đường cao tốc"" (highway signs), but the video seems to be on a regular road, not highway. So A is out. Option C has ""biển phụ"" (supplementary signs), which we don't see. So B is correct.

Got it, let's look at the video. It's a nighttime intersection. The road signs—wait, there's a sign for left turn, right turn, and straight. Wait, the question is about which directions are allowed. In the video, the traffic lights: the red light is for certain directions. But the options are A (straight), B (left), C (right), D (all). 

Wait, the intersection has markings. Let's check the signs. In the first frame, there's a sign that says ""30"" maybe, but also the direction signs. Wait, the question is about which directions are permitted. If the traffic light is red for some directions but the signs allow left, right, straight. Wait, but in many countries, at intersections, if there's no specific sign, but the video shows the signs. Wait, the video's first frame has a sign for left turn (arrow) and maybe right turn. Wait, the sign in the video: there's a ""No U-turn"" sign? Wait, no. Wait, looking at the video frames. The user is driving, and the road has markings. Let's check the signs in the video.

Got it, let's look at the traffic signs in the video. The overhead signs show directions. In the second frame, there are blue signs with arrows. Let's check the arrows. The signs indicate ""Đi thẳng"" (straight), ""Rẽ trái"" (left turn), and maybe ""Rẽ phải"" (right turn)? Wait, the question is about which directions are allowed at the intersection. The signs in the video: the blue signs have arrows. Let's see. The first frame has a sign that says ""50 km/h"" maybe, but the directions. In the second frame, the signs show straight, left, and right? Wait, no. Wait, the options are A: straight, left; B: straight, right; C: all; D: straight. Let's check the traffic signs. The overhead sign in the video—since it's a night scene, the blue signs with white arrows. Typically, in Vietnam, traffic signs for intersections: if there's a sign with straight, left, right arrows, then all directions are allowed. But let's check.

Got it, let's look at the video. The traffic light for left turn—wait, in the first frame, the traffic light is red for the main direction, but for left turn, maybe? Wait, the signs: there's a sign that says ""No left turn"" maybe? Wait, the traffic light: the red lights are for straight and maybe other directions. Wait, the first frame has a sign that's a ""No Left Turn"" sign (the circle with a left arrow crossed out). Oh, right, the sign in the video: there's a sign that's a red circle with a left arrow and a line through it, meaning no left turn. So if that sign is present, then vehicles can't turn left. So the question is, at the intersection, can vehicles turn left? The answer is no, because the sign prohibits it. So the answer is B.
