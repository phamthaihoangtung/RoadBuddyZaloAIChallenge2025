Got it, let's look at the video. The question is about whether the car turning right is heading to Xa Lộ Hà Nội. First, check the road signs. In the video, there's a sign that says ""Xa Lộ Hà Nội"". Now, the direction: if the car is turning right, does that lead to Xa Lộ Hà Nội? Wait, the question states ""nếu ô tô đi hướng chếch sang phải là hướng vào đường Xa Lộ Hà Nội"". So we need to see if turning right is towards Xa Lộ Hà Nội. 

Looking at the signs in the video: the signs above the road have ""Xa Lộ Hà Nội"" as an option. But when the car is going straight or turning, we need to check the lane. In the first frame, there are arrows. The right lane might be for Xa Lộ Hà Nội. Wait, but the question is whether turning right (chếch sang phải) is into Xa Lộ Hà Nội. If the signs indicate that the right direction is Xa Lộ Hà Nội, then it's correct. But let's think: the question is a statement—if the car turns right, it's heading to Xa L"

A. Biển hết tất cả các lệnh cấm. (Sign meaning ""End of all prohibitions"")

B. Báo hết hạn chế tốc độ tối đ (Probably ""End of maximum speed limit"" but the text is cut off, maybe ""Báo hết hạn chế tốc độ tối đa"")

C. Biển cấm đổ xe. (Sign meaning ""No dumping vehicles"" or ""No dumping"")

D. Báo hết cấm vượt. (Sign meaning ""End of no passing"")

Got it, let's figure out this question. The question is about a road sign in the video. The sign mentioned is a rectangular blue sign with a white symbol on the right side of the road, and the question is whether it means ""end of residential area"". 

First, I need to recall road sign standards. In many countries, including Vietnam (since the video has ""VIETMAP"" which is a Vietnamese navigation app), the sign for ""end of residential area"" is usually a specific shape. Let's think: residential area signs are often a blue background with a white symbol. But the question says the sign is a rectangular blue background with white. Wait, the standard sign for ""end of residential area"" in Vietnam is actually a rectangular sign with a blue background and a white house symbol, but the description here is ""hình chữ nhật nền xanh hình trắng bên phải đường"" which translates to ""rectangular blue background white symbol on the right side of the road"". 

Wait, but the sign for ""end of residential area"" is typically a white symbol on a blue background, but the actual sign might be different. Let me check: in Vietnam, the sign indicating the end of a residential area is usually a blue background with a white symbol"

Got it, let's look at the video. The question is about the warning sign in the video. First, identify the sign. In the first frame, there's a yellow triangular sign, which is a warning sign. Now, check the options.

Option C: ""Báo hiệu giao nhau với đường không ưu tiên liên tiếp, nơi giao nhau có tín hiệu đèn"" – that's a warning for consecutive intersections with no priority, where there's a traffic light. Wait, the sign in the video is a yellow triangle. Let's recall Vietnamese traffic signs. The sign shown is probably a warning for an intersection with no priority. The options: A is about traffic light, B is same-level intersection, C is consecutive intersections with no priority (and traffic light), D is slippery road and same-level intersection.

Looking at the video, the sign is a yellow triangle, which in Vietnam, the ""giao nhau với đường không ưu tiên"" (intersection with no priority) sign.

Got it, let's look at the video. The question is about the traffic sign on the left that indicates a pedestrian crossing. The options are A, B, C, D. 

First, the sign in question—pedestrian crossing signs typically mean that there's a place for pedestrians to cross. The options need to cover what the sign does. 

Option C says ""Biển báo chỉ dẫn nơi người đi bộ sang ngang, thông báo cho người tham gia giao thông biết vị trí dành cho người đi bộ băng qua đường an toàn. Người lái xe phải giảm tốc độ, quan sát và ưu tiên nhường đường cho người đi bộ."" So it's the sign indicating pedestrian crossing, informing traffic about the safe crossing area, and drivers must slow down, watch, and yield. 

Option D is missing the part about informing the traffic. Let's check. The standard meaning of a pedestrian crossing sign is that it marks where pedestrians can cross, so drivers should be aware and yield. 

In the video, the sign on the left—assuming it's a pedestrian crossing sign (like a zebra crossing), which is used to alert drivers that pedestrians may cross, so they need to slow down and yield.

Got it, let's figure out this question. The question is about the meaning of a continuous yellow line (vạch kẻ liền màu vàng) in traffic markings. The options are A. Forbidden stopping and parking zone, B. Area to park, C. Stop line, D. Forbidden parking zone.

First, I need to recall traffic sign knowledge. In many countries, a solid yellow line (or continuous yellow line) typically means that parking is not allowed in that area. It's a zone where vehicles must not stop or park. So option A says ""Khu vực cấm dừng cấm đỗ xe"" which translates to ""Forbidden stopping and parking area"". Option D is ""Khu vực cấm đỗ xe"" which is ""Forbidden parking area"". 

Wait, but let's check the options again. The question is about the solid yellow line. In Vietnam's traffic regulations, a continuous yellow line (vạch kẻ liền vàng) usually indicates that stopping or parking is prohibited. So the correct answer would be A, which is ""Khu vực cấm dừng cấm đỗ xe"" (forbidden to stop or park). 

Option D is ""Khu vực cấm đỗ xe"" (forbidden parking area), but maybe the solid"

The first frame has a sign, but in Vietnamese, ""trạm dừng nghỉ"" is rest stop. Now, the options are A (correct) or B (incorrect). Wait, the sign in the video—do we see a sign for rest stop? The first frame's sign might be a service area. But the question says ""biển báo xuất hiện trong video chỉ dẫn vị trí trạm dừng nghỉ"". If the sign is for a rest stop, then A is correct. But maybe in the video, the sign is not a rest stop. Wait, let's check the context. The video is a highway, and the signs might be for exits or services. But the question is about whether the sign indicates a rest stop. If the sign is a rest stop sign, then A (đúng) is correct. But maybe the sign in the video is not for that. Wait, the user provided the video frames, but in the frames, the sign in the first frame: there's a sign on the left. Let's think. In Vietnam, highway signs: ""trạm dừng nghỉ"

Got it, let's figure out the question. The question is asking about the meaning of the sign that appears in the video. The options are A to D.

First, I need to recall what the signs in the video might be. The video shows a highway with various signs. Let's think about common highway signs. Option A: rest area. Option B: technical inspection point. Option C: emergency phone. Option D: toll station.

In Vietnam, the sign that says ""Trạm dừng nghỉ"" is a rest area. But the question is about the sign in the video. Wait, the options: A is ""Chỉ dẫn vị trí trạm dừng nghỉ trên tuyến cao tốc"" which is rest area. B is technical inspection (maybe like weigh stations or checks). C is emergency phone. D is toll station.

Now, looking at the video, the first frame has a sign. Let's check the context. The sign in the video—since it's a highway, maybe the sign is for rest area. But let's think: in some cases, signs for rest areas are common. Alternatively, maybe the sign is a toll station. Wait, the options: D is ""Báo hiệu khu vực có trạm thu phí phía trước"""

C. Xe tải, xe ba bánh (trucks, three-wheeled vehicles)

Got it, let's figure out this question. The question is about the traffic sign on the lane the car is driving on. First, I need to recall the types of traffic signs:禁止 (prohibition), chỉ dẫn (directional), hiệu lệnh (command), or nguy hiểm (warning).

In the video, the signs visible are probably regulatory signs. Wait, the options are A. Cấm (prohibition), B. Chỉ dẫn (directional), C. Hiệu lệnh (command), D. Nguy hiểm (warning).

Looking at the context, the signs in the video—since it's a traffic sign, let's think. In Vietnam, traffic signs are categorized. Prohibition signs are like no entry, no parking, etc. Directional signs guide the direction. Command signs are mandatory instructions. Warning signs alert to hazards.

But the question is about the sign on the lane the car is in. Let's check the video frames. The first frame shows some signs. Wait, the problem says ""Biển báo giao thông xuất hiện trên làn đường đang chạy"" which translates to ""the traffic sign appearing on the lane being driven."" 

Now, in the video, the signs might be regulatory (cấm, hiệu lệnh) or warning"

But in the video, the traffic lights might show. Also, the road markings. Since it's a typical intersection, maybe the sign or the traffic light indicates.

First, in Vietnam, traffic signs that say ""cấm dừng và đỗ"" (prohibiting stopping and parking) usually apply to all vehicles unless specified otherwise. The sign in the image—wait, the video shows the road, but the question is about the sign's application. Typically, such signs are general unless there's a specific symbol. Since it's a standard sign (the red circle with a line through a symbol, maybe), in Vietnam, the ""Cấm dừng và đỗ"" sign is for all vehicles. Let me recall: in traffic regulations, a sign that prohibits stopping and parking (like the one with a red circle and a horizontal line through a car or truck) but if it's a general sign, it's for all. However, some signs might specify. But the question says ""trên làn đường đang chạy"" (on the current lane). The options: A is all. So if the sign is"

The signs in Vietnam: red circle with a line through a symbol. The sign in the first frame (left side) is a red sign with a white horizontal bar, which is ""Cấm dừng và đỗ xe"" (prohibits stopping and parking). Let's check the options. Option A is ""Cấm dừng và đỗ xe"", which matches. The other options: B is just ""cấm đỗ xe"", but the sign here is for both stopping and parking. C is reverse direction, D is turning back.

Wait, the options are 1, 2, 3, or 4. Let's think. In the first frame (0.0 seconds), the traffic light is green, and there's a sign on the left side. The second frame (0.5 seconds) shows another angle. Maybe the signs are the ones that are ""cấm"" (prohibitory).

Got it, let's look at the question. The question is about a traffic sign indicating the right lane for vehicles, and whether it's a sign for a hospital. First, I need to recall traffic signs. In Vietnam, the sign for a hospital is usually a specific symbol, like a white cross on a blue background or something similar.

Got it, let's figure out this traffic sign question. The question is about a sign that prohibits cars from parking on the right lane. The options are whether it's correct (A) or not (B). 

First, I need to recall Vietnamese traffic signs. The sign mentioned is ""cấm bên phải làn xe chạy có ý nghĩa chỉ cấm xe ô tô con đỗ, không cấm các loại xe khá"". Wait, the sign in the video—looking at the frames, the first frame has a sign that says ""BIDA"" but that's probably a street name. Wait, maybe the sign in question is the one that's a ""no parking"" sign. But the key is understanding the meaning. In Vietnam, some signs prohibit parking for specific vehicles. The question states that the sign on the right lane prohibits only small cars from parking, not other vehicles. 

But in standard traffic rules, a sign that prohibits parking (like a ""no parking"" sign) usually applies to all vehicles. If a sign specifically says it's for small cars (xe ô tô con), then maybe it's not a standard sign. Wait, the question is asking if the statement is correct. The statement says the sign prohibits only small cars from parking,"

Prohibition signs are usually red circles with a line through, like no entry, no parking, etc. In the video, the signs visible are more like commercial signs (e.g., ""TEO CHE 2"", ""RUA"", etc.) and maybe traffic signs, but do any of them look like prohibition signs? Let me think. The video shows busy street with shops, motorcycles, cars. The signs on the right are store signs. There's no clear red circular prohibition sign. So the answer is B. Không (No).

Got it, let's analyze the question. The video shows a busy urban street with many motorbikes, cars, etc. The question is whether the vehicle (from the dashcam perspective) can overtake the black car in front.

First, check traffic rules. In Vietnam, overtaking on a busy street with multiple vehicles. The key points: the road has a barrier (red and white), so it's a multi-lane road but maybe the overtaking is restricted. Wait, the question is about permission to overtake.

Option A: Allowed if safe and enough space to move left. Option B: Not allowed because many motorbikes. Option C: Allowed only if the black car signals. Option D: Not allowed because busy residential area.

In Vietnam, overtaking is allowed when it's safe, but in areas with high traffic, especially if the road has multiple lanes but the barrier might indicate it's a divided road. However, the main rule is that overtaking is allowed when safe and there's space. The video shows many vehicles, so overtaking might be risky. But the question is about if it's permitted.

The traffic laws in Vietnam state that overtaking is allowed on highways, multi-lane roads, but not in residential areas,"

First, I need to recall traffic rules regarding stopping. In many places, stopping on roads, especially in commercial areas, might have restrictions. The options mention ""đỗ xe"" (parking) vs ""dừng xe"" (stopping). 

Option B says it's a serious violation because it's ""đỗ xe"" and there's a sign banning parking in that time. The video shows a street with shops, so maybe there's a ""no parking"" sign. If the car stops to buy goods, that's parking (đỗ xe) which is prohibited during certain hours (7:00 AM here). So B says it's a serious violation because the sign is clear. 

Option D says minor violation for ""dừng xe"" (stopping) not parking. But stopping (dừng) vs parking (đỗ) are different. If it's parking, it's a violation. The context: if you stop to buy goods, you're parking there, which is against the rule.

Looking at the signs in the video. The sign might be a ""cấm dừng"" (no stopping) sign, which in Vietnam (since the video has Vietnamese text like ""VIETMAP"") often means no stopping at all, 24/7. So the sign is a prohibition for stopping, so it's effective 24/7. So the answer would be C: not allowed because it's 24/7. Let's check the options.

First, recall common Vietnamese traffic signs. In Vietnam, the circular red signs are usually prohibitory signs. Let's think about each option:

A. Cấm rẽ phải (Prohibits right turn) – that's a sign for right turns, usually a red circle with a right arrow crossed out.

B. Cấm rẽ trái (Prohibits left turn) – similar, red circle with left arrow crossed.

C. Cấm quay đầu xe (Prohibits U-turn) – red circle with a U-turn symbol crossed.

D. Cấm đi ngược chiều (Prohibits going the wrong way) – this might be a ""no entry"" or ""one-way"" sign? Wait, in Vietnam, ""cấm đi ngược chiều"" is about not driving against the flow, like a one-way sign or no entry.

Option A: Warns about road width 2.5m left. But the sign is triangular, which is usually for warnings. Option B: Prohibits vehicles wider than 2.5m. That's a prohibition sign, not triangular. Triangular signs are warnings. So C is about warning of actual clearance height. D is limiting vehicle height. But triangular sign is a warning, not a limit. So C is correct.

Got it, let's look at the video. The question is whether the vehicle is changing lanes (lấn làn). In the video, we see the car's dashboard view. The road has markings, and the car is moving along the lane. There's no indication of crossing into another lane. The other vehicles are in their lanes, and the car seems to be staying in one lane. So the answer should be B. Không.

Got it, let's look at the video. The question is about warning signs for dangers on the road. In the first frame, there's a sign that says ""2.5m"" which is probably the height restriction (static clearance). Then, the road has curves. Let's check the options.

Option A: Height clearance 2.5m and warning of consecutive sharp turns. The video shows a sign with ""2.5m"" (like a height limit) and the road has curves (since the street is winding). So that matches. 

Option B: Sharp turn and no parking. The video might have a sharp turn, but is there a no parking sign? The signs visible: first frame has a ""2.5m"" sign, which is height. Then the road curves, so maybe sharp turns. But no clear no parking sign here.

Option C: Obstacle 2.5m and speed limit. Speed limit sign isn't visible in the video. The ""2.5m"" is height, not obstacle. So C is wrong.

Option D: Road guide and pedestrian warning. The video shows a road with curves and height signs, not pedestrian warning.

So A is correct.

In Vietnam, triangular warning signs often indicate height restrictions. The sign here is a height limit sign. The text on the sign in the video (from the first frame) might show ""2.5m"". So the sign warns of a height limit for vehicles. Option B says ""Giới hạn chiều cao phương tiện là 2.5 mét"" which translates to ""Vehicle height limit is 2.5 meters"".

Got it, let's figure this out. The question is about a warning sign for dangerous bends that only applies to cars. First, I need to recall what the sign looks like. The sign mentioned is ""biển cảnh báo nhiều chỗ ngoặt nguy hiểm"" which is a warning sign for multiple dangerous bends. Now, in Vietnam, traffic signs have specific applications. The key point is whether this sign is only for cars. 

In reality, warning signs for dangerous bends (like sharp curves) are typically for all vehicles, not just cars. Because motorcycles and other vehicles also need to be warned. So if the statement says it's only for cars, that's incorrect. Therefore, the answer should be A. Sai (False).

B: Obstruction on the road. That's usually a different sign, maybe a square or circular with a specific symbol.

C: Priority vehicle going against direction—probably not, that's more about yielding or something else.

Got it, let's analyze the question. The question is about whether the driver is allowed to change lanes to overtake vehicles ahead. The options are A to D.

First, look at the road markings. In the video, the lane markings—specifically, the broken white lines. In traffic rules, a broken white line usually indicates that lane changes are allowed. But we need to check if there are any restrictions. The options: A says left lane is opposite direction (but the video shows a road with multiple lanes, and the left side might be a different lane, but the question is about overtaking. Wait, the key is the road markings. The broken white line between lanes allows changing lanes. Also, check if there's any sign or rule against it. Option B says ""được phép vì vạch đứt nét màu trắng cho phép chuyển làn""—so broken white line allows changing lanes. Now, the video shows the road with white broken lines, so in many countries (like Vietnam, which the GPS shows VietMap), broken white lines mean you can change lanes. But also, check if the lane is safe. However, the question is about the rule based on the markings. So option B is correct.

Option B: Maintain max speed and stay close to the lane divider—saying ""giữ"" (keep) close to the divider might be dangerous in heavy traffic, as you need space. 

Option C: Reduce speed, maintain distance, ready to yield when necessary for safety. In dense traffic, slowing down and being cautious is standard to avoid accidents.

First, in Vietnam (since the license plate has ""VIETMAP""), traffic rules: when there's a solid line (nét liền), you can't cross it. The question mentions ""vạch phân làn là nét liền không được đè"" which translates to ""the lane marking is a solid line, not to cross"".

Looking at the options:

A. Legal if fast and safe – but if the line is solid, overtaking is illegal regardless of speed.

B. Violation, solid line not to cross – this matches the rule.

C. Legal as long as not crossing the line – but if the line is solid, crossing is illegal. So this is wrong.

D. Violation only if white vehicle is slow – but the rule is about the line, not speed.

So the key is the solid line. The question says ""vạch phân làn là nét liền không được đè"" (solid line not to cross). So overtaking over a solid line is illegal. Therefore, the answer is B.

Got it, let's analyze the question. The question is in Vietnamese, and we need to choose the correct option based on the video. The video shows a car driving on a bridge with lane markings. The question is about what the lane markings indicate.

First, let's look at the options:

A. Tăng tốc để vượt qua các phương tiện khá (Increase speed to overtake vehicles) – but the video might not show overtaking, and lane markings usually don't mean speed up.

B. Duy trì tốc độ và chờ đợi tín hiệu đèn (Maintain speed and wait for traffic lights) – but the bridge doesn't have traffic lights visible here.

C. Chuẩn bị nhập làn hoặc giảm tốc độ khi hết vạch mũi tên (Prepare to change lanes or reduce speed when the arrow ends) – the lane markings might have arrows that indicate changing lanes or adjusting speed as the arrow ends.

D. Di chuyển sang sát lề phải ngay lập tứ (Immediately move to the right edge) – the video doesn't show an immediate right move.

In the video, the lane markings are probably guiding the driver. When lane markings have arrows, they often indicate where to change lanes or adjust speed. Option C mentions preparing to change lanes or reduce"

Got it, let's think. The question is about the safest driving behavior when approaching a group of two-wheeled vehicles (like motorcycles) on the bridge. First, I need to recall traffic safety rules. When approaching other vehicles, especially in a group, the safest thing is to maintain a safe distance. Let's look at the options.

Option A: Honk loudly and speed up to keep distance. Honking is not necessary here, and speeding up might be dangerous. So A is bad.

Option B: Reduce speed and maintain a safe distance. That makes sense. When approaching a group, slowing down to keep space is safe.

Option C: Flash high beams to warn them. Flashing high beams is not standard for this situation; it's more for night driving or specific warnings. It might confuse other drivers.

Option D: Keep speed and drive close to the left lane. Driving close to the lane is dangerous, as it's not safe to be too close to other vehicles. The safe practice is to maintain distance, not stay close.

So the correct answer should be B.

Option B says ""Chuyển sang làn bên phải khi điều kiện cho phép và an toàn"" which translates to ""Change to the right lane when conditions allow and safe."" That makes sense because in many places, you can change lanes if it's safe. 

Option A: Only overtaking motorbikes, not cars. But the video shows cars and motorbikes, so maybe not. But the question is about the right lane.

C is speed up (that would be dangerous near a pedestrian zone). D is stop completely, but maybe not necessary if it's a yield sign.

Now, looking at the video. The triangular sign—triangular signs in Vietnam (since the video has Vietnamese elements) often indicate a speed bump or a reduction in speed. For example, the sign that's triangular and has a downward slope symbol is for speed bumps (gồ giảm tốc). Let me check the options. Option C is ""Cảnh báo đường có gồ giảm tốc"" which translates to warning about speed bumps. 

So the triangular sign here is likely the one indicating a speed bump. Let's confirm. In Vietnam, the sign for speed bumps is a triangular sign with a downward slope, so it's a warning to slow down because of speed bumps. Therefore, the correct answer should be C.

First, look at the video. In the background, there's a ""No Entry"" sign (biển cấm), which is a prohibition sign (A). Also, check for others. Supplementary signs are like additional info to main signs, maybe not visible here. Command signs are orders like stop, go, which might not be present. Directional signs guide direction, like arrows. Let's see the signs in the video.

Wait, the video shows a ""No Entry"" sign (A is present). What about B (biển báo phụ)? Supplementary signs are usually smaller, like ""no entry"" might have a supplementary, but not sure. The options: need to find which is NOT present.

Wait, the question is which type does NOT appear. Let's recall sign types:

- Biển cấm (prohibition): like ""no entry"", which we can see (red circle with line, but in the video, there's a sign that says ""10"" maybe, but the ""no"

Got it, let's figure this out. The question is about the time when the ""no parking"" sign is in effect. First, I need to recall common regulations. In many places, no parking signs might have specific hours. Let's look at the options.

Option A: 6-9 and 19-21. Option B: 6-9 and 16-19. Option C: 9-16 and 19-21. Option D: 9-16 and 19-6 (which doesn't make sense, 19-6 is not a valid time frame).

Wait, maybe in some countries, no parking is during working hours (like 9-16) and evening hours (19-21). Let's check common examples. In Vietnam, maybe. But how to determine? The problem is from the video, but the video shows a no parking sign. Wait, the options have different time ranges.

Wait, the key is to think about typical regulations. No parking zones are often during the day (e.g., 9-16) and evenings (like 19-21). So option C: 9:00-1"

Got it, let's look at the video. The sign in the video is a red sign with a white circle and a red line through a three-wheeled vehicle and a bicycle (thô sơ). The question is about the hours this sign is effective. 

First, I need to recall the common times for such signs. The options are time ranges. In Vietnam, traffic signs for restricting three-wheeled vehicles and bicycles are often effective during peak hours. Let's check the options.

Option A: 6-12 and 14-20. That's typical morning and evening peaks. Option B: 5-13 and 16-22—maybe too late. Option C: 7-15 and 17-23. Option D: 4-12 and 15-21.

Wait, the sign is ""Biển cấm xe 3 bánh và xe thô sơ""—this is a restriction sign for three-wheeled vehicles and bicycles. In many urban areas, such restrictions are active during rush hours, which are typically 6-9 AM and 4-7 PM. But let's think about standard time frames.

Looking at the options, A is 6"

Got it, let's look at the video. The question is about the triangular warning signs. In Vietnam, triangular signs are warning signs. Let's recall the options. 

First, check the signs in the video. The video shows a construction area (so ""công trường đang thi công"" which is construction site). There's a yellow triangle sign, maybe ""giao nhau với đường không ưu tiên"" (unprioritized intersection), and ""người đi bộ sang ngang"" (pedestrian crossing). Also, maybe ""đi chậm"" (slow down)? Wait, but let's check the options.

Option D: Công trường đang thi công, giao nhau với đường không ưu tiên, người đi bộ sang ngang, cảnh báo đường trơn. Wait, but the video might have the triangular signs. Let's see the options given. The correct answer should include the signs present.

Looking at the video frames: first frame has a yellow triangle sign on the right (maybe pedestrian crossing), then the next frame shows construction barriers (red and yellow), so construction site sign. Also, the intersection might have a sign for unpriority road. 

Option B: Đi chậm, công trường đang thi công, giao nhau với đường"

The first frame has one. The second frame—maybe another? Wait, no. Wait, the first frame: the construction area has a yellow triangular sign (like a warning sign). Let's confirm. The first image shows a green fence with orange tape, and there's a yellow triangular sign (maybe the one on the fence). The second frame—when the car moves, does another one appear? No, the second frame shows a street with some buildings, but no triangular sign. Wait, maybe the first frame has one. So the answer would be A. 1 biển.

Got it, let's figure out this question. The task is to identify which types of road signs appear in the video. The options are about different categories: chỉ dẫn (indicative), phụ (supplementary), hiệu lệnh (command), etc.

First, I need to recall what each term means. Biển chỉ dẫn are directional signs (like destination, route). Biển báo phụ are supplementary signs (additional info, maybe like a note). Biển hiệu lệnh are regulatory signs (commands, like stop, speed limits).

Looking at the video: in the background, there's a bridge, buildings, and maybe some signs. Wait, the video shows a city street. Let's check the options. Option B says ""Biển chỉ dẫn, biển báo phụ, biển hiệu lệnh"" (indicative, supplementary, command). But do we see all three?

Wait, maybe in the video, there are signs. Let's think. The video shows a busy city street. Common signs: maybe a bridge sign, some traffic signs. But the question is about the types present.

The options: A is chỉ dẫn, phụ; B is all three; C is chỉ dẫn and hiệu lệnh; D is only chỉ dẫn.

In Vietnam, road signs include: chỉ dẫn"

Got it, let's figure out the meaning of the yellow triangle sign in the video. First, I need to recall traffic signs. The yellow triangle with an exclamation mark is a warning sign.

B. Warning of narrowing road. That's usually a sign with a narrowing road symbol, like two lines getting closer.

C. Construction site. Construction signs are often different, like a shovel or a worker.

D. Warning of intersection with a road without priority. That's a common sign for when you're approaching a junction where the road you're on doesn't have priority, so you need to be cautious.

Looking at the options, D seems correct. The yellow triangle sign here is likely the ""Caution: Yield"" sign, indicating that you need to yield to traffic on another road at an intersection.

Got it, let's figure this out. The question is about the number of road markings indicating no parking or stopping. In the video, we need to look for those specific markings. 

First, recall that in Vietnam (since the date is 13/10/2025, and the language is Vietnamese), road markings for no parking or stopping are usually red lines. But wait, the question is asking for how many types of such markings. 

Common types: maybe double solid lines (for no passing) but the question is about ""cấm đỗ cấm dừng xe"" (prohibiting parking and stopping). The standard markings for no parking/stopping are often single solid lines or double solid lines, but maybe in some cases there are different types. However, in many countries, the primary marking for no parking is a single red line. But let's check the video.

Wait, the video is a dashcam view. Looking at the road, the markings—do we see any? The options are A to D. The question is about types. Let's think: in Vietnam, the road markings for ""cấm đỗ"" (no parking) might have different types. But maybe the video shows one type. Wait, no"

Got it, let's see. The question is about the meaning of a yellow triangle sign in the video. First, I need to recall what yellow triangle signs usually mean in traffic. In Vietnam, the yellow triangle sign is often the yield sign, which means ""yield to other vehicles."" Looking at the options: A is ""Giao nhau với đường không ưu tiên"" which translates to ""Intersection with a non-priority road."" Wait, but the yellow triangle sign in many countries is a yield sign. Let me check the options again.

Option A: Giao nhau với đường không ưu tiên (Intersection with a non-priority road) – that might be the correct meaning. Because the yield sign (yellow triangle) is used when one road has priority, so you need to yield. So if it's a yellow triangle, it's the yield sign, meaning you yield at an intersection where the other road has priority. So the answer should be A.

Got it, let's figure out the question. The question is about the meaning of the yellow triangle sign in the video. First, I need to recall what traffic signs mean. The options are:

A. Đường không bằng phẳng (Uneven road)
B. Người đi bộ sang ngang (Pedestrians crossing)
C. Giao nhau với đường không ưu tiên (Intersection with a non-priority road)
D. Công trường đang thi công (Construction site)

Wait, the yellow triangle sign in Vietnam's traffic signs. Let me think. In many countries, a yellow triangular warning sign is used for various warnings. But in Vietnamese traffic signs, the yellow triangle sign for ""giao nhau với đường không ưu tiên"" (intersection with a non-priority road) is a common warning. Let's check the options again.

Option C: Giao nhau với đường không ưu tiên. That's when you're approaching an intersection where the road you're on doesn't have priority, so you need to be cautious. 

Let me confirm. The yellow triangular sign in traffic is typically a warning sign. In Vietnam, the sign for ""Intersection with a non-priority road"" is a yellow triangle. So the correct answer should be C.

Got it, let's figure out the question. The question is about the meaning of the circular sign in the video. The options are:

A. Hướng đi thẳng phải theo (Straight direction must follow)

B. Nơi giao nhau chạy theo vòng xuyến (Intersection where vehicles go around a roundabout)

C. Làn đường dành riêng cho xe buýt (Bus-only lane)

D. Rẽ trái bắt buộc (Mandatory left turn)

First, I need to recall what a circular sign in traffic usually means. In many countries, a circular sign (like a roundabout sign) indicates a roundabout. So the sign would mean that the intersection is a roundabout, where vehicles go around in a circle.

Looking at option B: ""Nơi giao nhau chạy theo vòng xuyến"" translates to ""Intersection where vehicles go around a roundabout,"" which matches the typical meaning of a roundabout sign.

Check other options: A is about straight direction, which is not a circular sign. C is bus lane, which is usually a different sign (like a bus symbol). D is mandatory left turn, which is a different sign (like a left arrow).

So the correct answer should be B.

First, check the video frames. The car is moving forward along the road. There's no indication of turning left or right; the vehicle is going straight. The road has multiple lanes, and the car is in one of them, moving forward without changing direction. So the direction is straight. Therefore, the answer is A.

Got it, let's try to figure this out. The question is asking where turning right in the video will lead. First, I need to recall the landmarks in the video. The video shows a busy street with flags, buildings, and signs. The options are Chợ Bến Thành, Cầu Sài Gòn, Khu công nghiệp Cát Lái, Cầu Phú Mỹ.

Looking at the context: In Ho Chi Minh City, Cầu Sài Gòn (Saigon Bridge) is a major bridge. The road signs might indicate directions. Also, the location in the video has flags, which might be near a significant landmark. Chợ Bến Thành is a famous market, but the road signs here—since it's a busy street, maybe the direction to Cầu Sài Gòn. Wait, the video's coordinates: E106.70633, N10.77162. Let me think. The Saigon Bridge is a key location. Alternatively, Cầu Phú Mỹ is another bridge. But looking at the options, the correct answer might be B. Cầu Sài Gòn. Because when you turn right on this road, it's likely towards the Saigon Bridge. Let me confirm. The video shows a city"

Got it, let's look at the video. The question is about the sign on the bridge. The options are A to D. First, I need to recall what each sign means. The video shows a bridge with traffic.

Looking at the options:

A. Cấm đỗ xe ngày lẻ, cấm đỗ xe ngày chẵn – so odd/even days parking ban. But the video might not show that. 

B. Cấm đỗ xe, cấm đỗ xe ngày lẻ – one is no parking, another is no parking on odd days. Not sure.

C. Cấm dừng đỗ xe, cấm đỗ xe – no stopping/parking, and no parking. But maybe the signs are specific.

D. Cấm đỗ xe ngày chẵn, cấm dừng đỗ xe – no parking on even days, no stopping/parking.

Got it, let's tackle this question. The question is about the meaning of the time markers on the rectangular sign. First, I need to recall what such signs typically mean. In traffic signs, a sign with time periods like 6h-9h and 16h-19h usually indicates when a restriction applies. The options are about whether it's applying or not applying the ban during those times.

Looking at the options: A says the ban applies from 6-9 and 16-19. B says it doesn't apply then. C and D are about specific hours (6,9,16,19) as application times. But the sign has ranges (6h-9h), so it's the time periods when the restriction is in effect. So the correct answer should be A, as the time markers indicate the hours when the ban is applied.

Got it, let's figure out this question. The question is about identifying the group of circular signs in the video. The options are A. Instruction signs, B. Prohibition signs, C. Supplementary signs, D. Warning signs.

First, I need to recall the categories of traffic signs. In many traffic sign systems, circular signs are typically used for prohibitory signs (like ""no entry"", ""no parking"") or sometimes regulatory signs. But let's think about the Vietnamese system, since the video has ""VIETMAP"" which is related to Vietnam.

In Vietnam's traffic sign system, circular signs are usually ""biển báo cấm"" (prohibition signs). For example, a red circle with a line through a symbol means prohibition. So the question is asking which group the circular signs belong to.

Got it, let's figure out this question. The question is asking which vehicles are prohibited on the road in the video. The options are A to D. First, I need to look at the road signs in the video. The video shows a street with various signs. In Vietnam, road signs often have specific symbols. The ""xe lam"" is a type of vehicle, maybe a cart or a specific local vehicle. Also, ""xe xích lô"" is a cyclo (like a bicycle taxi), and ""xe lam"" might be a cart. Let's check the options.

Option A: Xe tải (truck), xe xích lô (cyclo), xe lam (cart). Option B: Xe container, xe đạp (bicycle), xe lam. Option C: Xe tải, xe xích lô, ba bánh (three-wheeler). Option D: Xe container, xe xích lô, xe lam.

Now, in the video, the road signs—there's a sign with a red circle and a line through it, which usually means prohibited. The sign might indicate which vehicles are not allowed. In Vietnam, some roads prohibit trucks, cyclos, etc. But let's recall that """
